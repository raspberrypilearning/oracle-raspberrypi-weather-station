## Introduction

This project takes you through all the steps needed to assemble, program and install an Oracle Raspberry Pi Weather station. These kits were sent to schools in 2015 & 2016. If you don't have one of these kits and are looking to build your own weather station, then please look at this [project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/build-your-own-weather-station) instead.

### What you will make

The Oracle Raspberry PI Weather station can measure and record:

+ Air temperature
+ Humidity
+ Ground temperature
+ Air Quality
+ Wind speed and direction
+ Rainfall
+ Atmospheric pressure

The entire software installation process can take a while, especially if you have a slow Internet connection. If youâ€™re planning to carry out the installation as part of a lesson or club, it is probably a good idea to download everything you need (especially SD card images), burn the SD card and perform any software updates before the session.
