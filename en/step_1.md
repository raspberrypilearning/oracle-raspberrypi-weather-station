## Introduction

This project takes you through all of the steps that you need to take to assemble, program, and install a Raspberry Pi Oracle Weather Station. The Weather Station kits were sent to schools in 2015 and 2016. If you don't have one of these kits and are looking to build your own weather station, then please look at [this project](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/build-your-own-weather-station) instead.

### What you will make

The Raspberry Pi Oracle Weather station can measure and record:

+ Air temperature
+ Humidity
+ Ground temperature
+ Air quality
+ Wind speed and direction
+ Rainfall
+ Atmospheric pressure

This project involves the following concepts:

+ Meteorology
+ Python programming
+ Databases
+ Basic electronic sensors
+ Networking

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Use manufacturing techniques and tools to create a completed product](https://curriculum.raspberrypi.org/manufacture/developer/)

+ [Process input data to monitor or react to the environment](https://curriculum.raspberrypi.org/physical-computing/developer/)

+ [Apply abstraction and decomposition to solve more complex problems](https://curriculum.raspberrypi.org/programming/developer/)

The entire software installation process can take a while, especially if you have a slow internet connection. If youâ€™re planning to carry out the installation as part of a lesson or club session, you may wish to download everything you need (especially SD card images), burn the SD card, and perform any software updates before the session.
