## Assemble your Weather Station

### Set up the Weather Station HAT

1. Your Raspberry Pi Weather Station should arrive in a sleeved box.

1. Use the four 8mm screws and the four hex spacers to affix the Raspberry Pi to its acrylic base. Then, place the tall header (CN19895 receptacle) over the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.

1. Place a plastic card (e.g. a credit card) between the pins on the header to angle each row of pins outwards a little, to ensure that a good contact is made.

### Power up the Raspberry Pi

1. You can now plug a keyboard, mouse, Ethernet cable, and HDMI cable into the Raspberry Pi.
